Analyses of RNAseq data from Panacea project

Paclitaxel induces degeneration of sensory neurons leading to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. In iPSC-derived nociceptors, the multi-targeting kinase inhibitor KW2449 appears to rescue neurons. Based on physiological studies, paclitaxel and Kw2449 appears to differentially impact cancer cell lineages. We aimed to describe the transcriptional differences between the two cell types treated with paclitaxel +/- Kw2449.

RNAseq datasets were collected from different treatments and timepoints of nociceptors and breast cancer cell lines.
